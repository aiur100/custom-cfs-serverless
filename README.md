# Voice Foundry Web App

This is a weather web app that is powered by DarkSky API, AWS Lambda, AWS API Gateway and AWS S3.  The front-end/client side application is built on React, and the app is deployed to S3 using the S3 static website feature available.  

* The `./api` directory contains the lambda source for the server-side responses.  
* The `./spa` directory (representing single page application) will contain the web app. 
* The `./tests` directory will contain all tests needed for the API, and the front end tests.
